  * moblock-0.8-r4: MoBlock.c: Added missing #include <limits.h> (error: ‘INT_MIN’ and ‘INT_MAX’ undeclared with new stable gcc 4.3.2-r3)
  * moblock-0.8-r4: conf.d   : Templist is changed in badpeers.

  12 Aug 2008; Zorzo Luca
  * Added check for CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STATE in moblock-0.8-r2.ebuild and moblock-0.8-r3.ebuild, necessary to avoid iptable's "iptables: No chain/target/match by that name" error.
  * Changed "source " to "source /etc/init.d/functions.sh" in both moblock-stats and moblock-updates scripts. This is because in >sys-apps/baselayout-2.0.0 there isn't /etc/functions.sh anymore. (thanks to Santiago M. Mola and Sunrise overlay's stuff)
